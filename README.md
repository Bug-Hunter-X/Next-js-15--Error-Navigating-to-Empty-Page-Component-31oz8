# Next.js 15 Empty Page Component Error

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where navigating to a page component that is empty or contains only comments throws an error.  The error message varies depending on the environment, but generally indicates a problem with rendering or parsing the empty component.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`.

You should see an error in your browser's console.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that every page component returns a valid JSX element, even if it's just an empty div:

```javascript
// pages/about.js
export default function About() {
  return <div/>;
}
```
